Following comments have special meaning in Explorer# source code:

//HACK
  (normal priority)
  Bad code that should be rewritten.

//IMPLEMENT
  (normal priority)
  Used to mark areas that still have to be implemented.

//SHITE
  (high priority)
  Horrible code that should be fixed ASAP and preferably not commited to 
  source control at all.

//TODO
  (normal priority) 
  Normal "to do".

//TPK
  (low priority)
  Workaround/hack to support certain things that could have been implemented better 
  but had to be done differently to support quirks of the other clients (basically
  things that Java client does wrong ;-) or iPhone client).

HACK and TODO comments are automatically supported by Visual Studio. The rest
should be added by you! (with priority icons as noted in brackets above)
