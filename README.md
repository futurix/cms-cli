# Client for mobile CMS

This is a Windows Phone 7 client for unreleased mobile-first CMS. It is non-functional due to lack of available content servers, but I wanted to publish it as a good showcase for working with many Windows Phone APIs. Back in the day I was rather proud of this code!

Tools:  
Visual Studio 2010
